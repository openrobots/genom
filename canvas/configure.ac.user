dnl Add your customization of the configure process here
dnl	* use the AC_CONFIG_FILES macro to add files to be generated by configure
dnl	* use the the EXTRA_SUBDIRS variable to register new topdir directories. For instance
dnl	    EXTRA_SUBDIRS="lib"
dnl         will make autoconf generate lib/Makefile and the top makefile will recurse into it.
dnl         User subdirectories are built after the server part and before the codels
dnl     * use the EXTRA_PKGCONFIG to register new .pc.in files. If a module 'foo' sources 
dnl	    include a library 'libfoo', you can write your own foo-lib.pc.in file and add
dnl	    EXTRA_PKGCONFIG=foo-lib
dnl	    Then, autoconf will generate foo-lib.pc and it will get automatically installed
