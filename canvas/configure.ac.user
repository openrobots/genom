dnl Add your customization of the configure process here
dnl (but m4 macros must be put in acinclude.user.m4)
dnl
dnl	* use the AC_CONFIG_FILES macro to add files to be generated by 
dnl	  configure
dnl	* use the the EXTRA_SUBDIRS variable to register new topdir 
dnl       directories. For instance: EXTRA_SUBDIRS="lib"
dnl       will make autoconf generate lib/Makefile and the top makefile  
dnl       will recurse into it.
dnl       User subdirectories are built after the server part and before 
dnl       the codels
dnl     * use the EXTRA_PKGCONFIG to register new .pc.in files. If a 
dnl       module 'foo' sources include a library 'libfoo', you can write
dnl       your own foo-lib.pc.in file and add: EXTRA_PKGCONFIG=foo-lib
dnl	  Then, autoconf will generate foo-lib.pc and it will get 
dnl       automatically installed
