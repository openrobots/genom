 61. Provides CODEL_LIBS in the Generated Makefile in codels, holding
     all libraries requires by codels via 'codels_require' in the .gen
 60. Init requests are implicitely incompatible with all other requests.
 59. Removed VxWorks support.
 58. Don't initialize pocolibs timers if there is no periodic task.
 57. Search for includes in local directories before any other
     directory so that wrong header files from a previous installation
     cannot be included by mistake.

genom 2.0 Release Candidate 2, February 7, 2007.
 56. Make Genom actually stop after errors int the parser.
 55. Add a chapter in the manual on Genom's syntax.
 54. Fix autogen script to work with aclocal 1.10.
 53. Speed up the killmodule script in the case where the process already
     died, and make it take the H2DEV_DIR environment variable into account.
 52. Allow package names in require and codels_requires field to be
     protected by double quote, so that require: "pkg >= n.n" works.
 51. User-controlled poster declarations without an explicit variable name
     are now obsolete (forbidden).
 50. Obsolete syntax now generate an error by default. The new -O option
     can be used to force genom to accept it, at the users' risk.
 49. Check for the need for the -pthread option to get functionnal POSIX
     threads. 
 48. The TCP port used by tclserv can now also be given with 
     option -p<port>.
 47. Message 'csLib wakeup' was too much verbose with -c option.
 46. Name of a variable cannot be identical to the name of the C type 
     (it was the case for user posters with only a type)
 45. In Emacs genom-mode, Select codel files according to lang.
 44. Fix dependencies in generated server Makefile. 

genom 2.0 Release Candidate 1, December 19, 2006.
 43. Use g++ as the linker of modules declared with lang: "c++".
 42. Add lang keyword in module declaration. Supported options are `lang: c'
     (default) and `lang: c++'. Old syntax `use_cxx: 1' supported but
     deprecated. Generate codel files with proper extension (.cc for c++).
 41. Add support for installing generated modules in DESTDIR.
 40. Add support for installing in DESTDIR to genom itself.
 39. Remove support for xes.
 38. Add support for 'long long' and 'unsigned long long' (64 bit integer
     types) to genom. Not supported by OpenPRS bindings for now.
 37. Added automatic mboxInit call after a successful lm in tclserv
     client code. Can be disabled with a new option `-no-auto-connect' of
     lm command.
 36. New names for some fields in the .gen file (c_func -> codel). See 
     documentation for details.
 35. If the H2DEV_DIR environment variable is set, we save the PID
     files in here. This envvar is used by pocolibs to set its device file
 34. New option '-a' to generate module api only (not the module server)
 33. Remove use of separate *Proto.h for function prototypes.
 32. Rename TCLSERVMODULEPATH environment variable to TCLSERV_MODULE_PATH
     and allow definition of a colon-separated list of paths.
 31. Add 'extern "C"' declaration for user codels prototypes in header.h.
 30. Add preliminary Xenomai 2.x (using the POSIX skin) support.
 29. Disable old RTAI support in autoconf scripts.
 28. Update killmodule script for new SIGTERM behaviour.
 27. Add a signal handler that allows to kill a module cleanly with SIGTERM.
 26. Some more translations of module canvas files to english.
 25. Renamed xxxEssay into xxxTest.
 24. Fix 'extern "C"' declaration for msgLibProto.h.
 23. Cleanup some duplicated comments in generated files. 
 22. Explicit '--help' and '-h' options for genom.

[xxx lots of missing things there]

 21. Added a --with-kernel-includes option when configuring for RTAI, in
     case kernel headers and RTAI headers are not in the same path.
 20. Clarified the confirmation message to send a control request.
 19. By default, generate a configure script that looks for Tcl even if
     -t wasn't given with -i. This was a bit misleading people who
     forgot the -t when bootstraping the module.
 18. Changed the minimum mailbox size for receiving requests to at least
     sizeof(int) because of the Abort request.
 17. Added a few extern "C" declarations to tackle C++ compatibility.
 16. Added more default paths to standard Tcl installations.
 15. Added the possibility to define the name of a member of a poster
     defined by a 'type', with the syntax <name>::<type>. Sharing the
     same name between the type and the structure member doesn't work
     with g++ 3.3.4. 

genom 1.1 released July 22, 2004

 14. Changed hierarchy of canvas directory: it has now `server', `codels'
     and `autoconf' directories. This is more consistent with what is
     generated.
 13. Generate files in '.genom' directory, and move them to user
     directories afterwards. This way it will be possible to implement
     incremental patching for files that are both generated and modified
     by users. 
 12. Modules files are now intalled in $(bindir)/$(module) and
     $(libdir)/$(module).
 11. Changed -i option so that it generates only user files. Handy for
     bootstrapping a module.
 10. Added an automatic -I directive that points to the directory of the
     .gen file so that we can fetch include files there.
  9. Uniquify tclserv mailbox name (Sara Fleury).
  8. Added RTAI support.
  7. Renamed config.h to genom-config.h in order to avoid name clashes
     with <linux/config.h> when compiling for RTAI.
  6. Handle enum types in typeGen() for types declared in the .gen file.
  5. Removed old makefiles from LAAS distribution. Configuring modules
     from within the source directory now works.
  4. Renamed portLib options into pocolibs.  Look for pocolibs in
     $exec_prefix/lib and $prefix/lib instead of using $libdir which causes
     weird problems...
  3. Add the codel_files attribute to module declarations in order to add
     more files than the default ones in the codels directory. Also make
     the perl script more robust with sed quoting within regexps.
  2. upgrade to libtool 1.5 and handle cross-compilation more cleanly.
  1. configure fix: more robust pthread checking, add -lrt and -lm.
