 26. Update killmodule script for new SIGTERM behaviour.
 25. Add a signal handler that allows to kill a module cleanly with SIGTERM.
 25. Some more translations of module canvas files to english.
 24. Fix 'extern "C"' declaration for msgLibProto.h.
 23. Cleanup some duplicated comments in generated files. 
 22. Explicit '--help' and '-h' options for genom.

[xxx lots of missing things there]

 21. Added a --with-kernel-includes option when configuring for RTAI, in
     case kernel headers and RTAI headers are not in the same path.
 20. Clarified the confirmation message to send a control request.
 19. By default, generate a configure script that looks for Tcl even if
     -t wasn't given with -i. This was a bit misleading people who
     forgot the -t when bootstraping the module.
 18. Changed the minimum mailbox size for receiving requests to at least
     sizeof(int) because of the Abort request.
 17. Added a few extern "C" declarations to tackle C++ compatibility.
 16. Added more default paths to standard Tcl installations.
 15. Added the possibility to define the name of a member of a poster
     defined by a 'type', with the syntax <name>::<type>. Sharing the
     same name between the type and the structure member doesn't work
     with g++ 3.3.4.

 14. Changed hierarchy of canvas directory: it has now `server', `codels'
     and `autoconf' directories. This is more consistent with what is
     generated.
 13. Generate files in '.genom' directory, and move them to user
     directories afterwards. This way it will be possible to implement
     incremental patching for files that are both generated and modified
     by users. 
 12. Modules files are now intalled in $(bindir)/$(module) and
     $(libdir)/$(module).
 11. Changed -i option so that it generates only user files. Handy for
     bootstrapping a module.
 10. Added an automatic -I directive that points to the directory of the
     .gen file so that we can fetch include files there.
  9. Uniquify tclserv mailbox name (Sara Fleury).
  8. Added RTAI support.
  7. Renamed config.h to genom-config.h in order to avoid name clashes
     with <linux/config.h> when compiling for RTAI.
  6. Handle enum types in typeGen() for types declared in the .gen file.
  5. Removed old makefiles from LAAS distribution. Configuring modules
     from within the source directory now works.
  4. Renamed portLib options into pocolibs.  Look for pocolibs in
     $exec_prefix/lib and $prefix/lib instead of using $libdir which causes
     weird problems...
  3. Add the codel_files attribute to module declarations in order to add
     more files than the default ones in the codels directory. Also make
     the perl script more robust with sed quoting within regexps.
  2. upgrade to libtool 1.5 and handle cross-compilation more cleanly.
  1. configure fix: more robust pthread checking, add -lrt and -lm.
