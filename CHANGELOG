$LAAS$

 14. Changed hierarchy of canvas directory: it has now `server', `codels'
     and `autoconf' directories. This is more consistent with what is
     generated.
 13. Generate files in '.genom' directory, and move them to user
     directories afterwards. This way it will be possible to implement
     incremental patching for files that are both generated and modified
     by users. 
 12. Modules files are now intalled in $(bindir)/$(module) and
     $(libdir)/$(module).
 11. Changed -i option so that it generates only user files. Handy for
     bootstrapping a module.
 10. Added an automatic -I directive that points to the directory of the
     .gen file so that we can fetch include files there.
  9. Uniquify tclserv mailbox name (Sara Fleury).
  8. Added RTAI support.
  7. Renamed config.h to genom-config.h in order to avoid name clashes
     with <linux/config.h> when compiling for RTAI.
  6. Handle enum types in typeGen() for types declared in the .gen file.
  5. Removed old makefiles from LAAS distribution. Configuring modules
     from within the source directory now works.
  4. Renamed portLib options into pocolibs.  Look for pocolibs in
     $exec_prefix/lib and $prefix/lib instead of using $libdir which causes
     weird problems...
  3. Add the codel_files attribute to module declarations in order to add
     more files than the default ones in the codels directory. Also make
     the perl script more robust with sed quoting within regexps.
  2. upgrade to libtool 1.5 and handle cross-compilation more cleanly.
  1. configure fix: more robust pthread checking, add -lrt and -lm.
