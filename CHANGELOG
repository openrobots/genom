$LAAS$

  8. Added RTAI support.
  7. Renamed config.h to genom-config.h in order to avoid name clashes
     with <linux/config.h> when compiling for RTAI.
  6. Handle enum types in typeGen() for types declared in the .gen file.
  5. Removed old makefiles from LAAS distribution. Configuring modules
     from within the source directory now works.
  4. Renamed portLib options into pocolibs.  Look for pocolibs in
     $exec_prefix/lib and $prefix/lib instead of using $libdir which causes
     weird problems...
  3. Add the codel_files attribute to module declarations in order to add
     more files than the default ones in the codels directory. Also make
     the perl script more robust with sed quoting within regexps.
  2. upgrade to libtool 1.5 and handle cross-compilation more cleanly.
  1. configure fix: more robust pthread checking, add -lrt and -lm.
